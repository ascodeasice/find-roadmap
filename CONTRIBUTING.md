# Contributing to find-roadmap

Welcome to find-roadmap! Thank you for considering contributing. You can contribute in two ways: by requesting a roadmap through an issue or by adding new resources via a pull request.

## How to Contribute

### Requesting a Roadmap

If you need a roadmap for a specific topic:

1. Go to the ["Issues"](https://github.com/ascodeasice/find-roadmap/issues) tab
2. Create a new issue, using the provided template to describe the topic needed.

### Adding Resources

To add a new roadmap or tutorial:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/find-roadmap.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b add-new-roadmap`
4. If the topic doesn't exist, create new topic like `## Rust`, then put the resource under it.
5. Add the roadmap under the topic using this format: ` - [Resource Name](link): Description (optional) `
6. Commit your changes and push to your forked repository.
7. Open a Pull Request (PR) from your forked repository to the main repository, including a clear description of your changes.
8. If someone is asking for the roadmap in ["Issues"](https://github.com/ascodeasice/find-roadmap/issues), you may comment about the new roadmap.
